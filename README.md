## Scissor

Brief is the new black, this is what inspires the team at Scissor. In today’s world, it’s important to keep things as short as possible, and this applies to more concepts than you may realize. From music, speeches, to wedding receptions, brief is the new black. Scissor is a simple tool which makes URLs as short as possible. Scissor thinks it can disrupt the URL shortening industry and give the likes of bit.ly and ow.ly a run for their money within 2 years.
Requirements And Implementation Guide:

## - URL Shortening: 
Scissor allows users to shorten URLs by pasting a long URL into the Scissor platform and a shorter URL gets automatically generated. The shortened URL is designed to be as short as possible, making it easy to share on social media or through other channels.

## - Custom URLs:
Scissor also allows users to customize their shortened URLs. Users can choose their own custom domain name and customize the URL to reflect their brand or content. This feature is particularly useful for individuals or small businesses who want to create branded links for their website.

## - QR Code Generation:
Scissor allows users to also generate QR codes for the shortened URLs. Users can download the QR code image and use it in their promotional materials or/and on their website. This feature will be implemented using a third-party QR code generator API, which can be integrated into the Scissor platform.

## - Analytics:
Scissor provides basic analytics that allow users to track their shortened URL's performance. Users can see how many clicks their shortened URL has received and where the clicks are coming from. This feature will be implemented using Firebase's built-in analytics feature.


## Best Practices:
1. Build and deploy a scalable code base with proper code linting and formatting with Prettier and Eslint.

2. Ensure you use typescript with either Vuejs or React with necessary SEO in place.

3. You are required to build with either Firebase, Hasura or any backend technology that will allow you to store user data and carry out authentication.
4. It is important to allow the user of Scissor to write content with markdown.

5. Form validation is important.

6. At least 2 unit tests and 3 component tests should be present in the codebase.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
